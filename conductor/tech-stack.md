# Tech Stack

## Programming Language
*   **Python:** The primary programming language for the project, chosen for its extensive libraries in scientific computing, machine learning, and data analysis.

## Core Libraries
*   **NumPy:** Essential for numerical operations, especially for handling arrays and matrices efficiently, which are fundamental in cellular automata simulations and reservoir computing.
*   **Scikit-learn:** A robust library for machine learning tasks, providing tools for data mining and data analysis, which will be crucial for benchmarking and classifying reservoir computing models.
*   **Matplotlib:** Utilized for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python, vital for presenting the complex behaviors of cellular automata and microbiome models.
