# Initial Concept
Elementary cellular automata reservoir computing benchmarks and experiments.

# Product Definition

## Primary Goal
The primary goal of the `computingMicrobiome` project is to explore the idea that microbiomes help their hosts compute by acting as physical computing reservoirs. Initially, elementary cellular automata will be used as proxies for microbiomes, with plans to incorporate microbiome models like the consumer resource model in the future.

## Target Users
The project targets two primary groups of users:
*   Researchers in theoretical computer science, interested in new computational paradigms.
*   Biologists studying microbiomes, seeking to understand their computational aspects.

## Key Features
The `computingMicrobiome` project will offer the following key features and functionalities:
*   **Simulation Tools:** Provide robust tools for simulating elementary cellular automata and, eventually, microbiome models.
*   **Benchmarking:** Include utilities for benchmarking and comparing the performance of various reservoir computing models.
*   **Visualization:** Offer comprehensive visualization capabilities for both cellular automata and microbiome models to aid in understanding complex behaviors.
*   **Data Analysis:** Equip users with data analysis tools to interpret simulation results and derive meaningful insights.

## Long-term Vision
The long-term vision for `computingMicrobiome` is to provide insights into the computational capabilities of biological microbiomes and to deliver robust simulation capabilities that can advance the understanding of biological computation.
